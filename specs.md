# Flow Chart Editor - Requirements Specification (Version 1.7.14)

## Project Overview
A comprehensive flow chart editor built with typescript and esbuild without external frameworks, featuring modular architecture, dynamic UI creation, and advanced connection management.

## Rebuild Guide (LLM / Engineer Oriented)
This section enumerates the exact components, contracts, and algorithms required to faithfully recreate the application from scratch without accessing the original source. Follow steps in order; every symbol is intentional.

### 1. Tech & Build Baseline
- Tooling: TypeScript (ES2018 target), esbuild bundler (IIFE output) ‚Üí single `dist/app.js` bundled from `src/app.ts`.
- No runtime frameworks (no React/Vue/etc). Pure DOM APIs.
- Tests: Vitest + jsdom. Suggested folder: `src/__tests__` (current tests exist but not enumerated here; replicate based on Test Matrix).
- Entry HTML (`index.html`): body contains a single root container `<div id="app"></div>` plus `<script src="dist/app.js"></script>` and `<link rel="stylesheet" href="themes.css">`, `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`.

### 2. Global CSS & Theming Contract
- Two CSS files:
	1. `themes.css`: declares all `--fc-` variables including colors, grid sizing (`--fc-grid-minor-size:16px`, `--fc-grid-major-size:80px`), line colors (`--fc-grid-minor-line`, `--fc-grid-major-line`), and theme variant scopes via `:root[data-theme="<name>"]`.
	2. `styles.css`: structural/layout styles, grid background gradients; adaptive variant `.fc-canvas.with-grid.grid-zoom-far` (only major lines) used when zoom < 0.55.

### 3. Core Data Structures (Type Summary)
Replicate `AppState`, `Block`, `Connection`, `ViewportState` exactly as documented under Core Data Schema. Reducer must be pure, keyed by action types under Action Contract.

### 4. Store & Dispatch Enhancement
- Provide a minimal Store with methods: `getState()`, `dispatch(action)`, optional `subscribe`. No middleware chain; enhancement occurs in `FlowchartApp.enhanceDispatch` to wrap undo operation logic and minimap notifications.
- Operation-based undo uses `UndoManager` with APIs: `begin(label)`, `commitIfChanged()`, `cancel()`, `run(label, fn)`. Each logical operation encloses state mutations; move (drag) coalesced until pointer up.

### 5. Managers & Their Responsibilities
- `BlockManager`: create/render/update blocks; maintains DOM elements with ids equal to block ids; updates position styles after reducer changes; handles ResizeObserver to capture size updates.
- Each block DOM includes exactly one connection anchor element (class `.fc-block-anchor`) positioned (e.g., centered on right edge) used to initiate a connection draft via pointer drag. Anchor emits pointerdown leading to `START_CONNECTION_DRAFT` with source block id.
- `ConnectionManager`: render all connections into SVG layer; update connections referencing a moved/resized block; manage markers & deletion icon.
- `GridManager`: apply/remove `with-grid`; persist settings to localStorage key `fc-grid`; listen to `viewport:change` to toggle `grid-zoom-far` below scale threshold 0.55.
- `ThemeManager`: restore last selected theme (`fc-theme`), manage custom themes (`fc-custom-themes`), generate swatch previews (`fc-theme-previews`). Applies custom theme by injecting a `<style>` block with `:root[data-theme="<custom>"]`.
- `FileIO`: export/import JSON (stringify entire AppState); import path validates structural shape.
- `HotkeysManager`: global listeners for undo/redo, escape, selection operations.
- `MinimapManager`: canvas overlay (200√ó200) bottom-left; renders block rectangles, selection highlight, viewport rectangle; supports click-to-center & drag viewport rectangle; visibility persisted under `fc-minimap-enabled`.
- `ViewportController`: handle pan (pointer drag), wheel zoom with `Ctrl`, pinch zoom, maintain scale within bounds, emit `viewport:change` via EventBus.
- `ConnectionDraftController`: transient connection creation; Esc cancels; draft line follows pointer.
- `UndoDebugPanel` (optional/dev): attaches when `?undoDebug=1`; shows undo/redo stack meta.

### 6. Event Bus
- Generic `EventBus<EventMap>` supporting `on`, `off`, `emit`.
- `EventMap` includes: `viewport:change`, `connection:draft:start|end`, `connection:added`, `block:drag:start|end`.
- Consumers: `GridManager` (for adaptive grid), `MinimapManager`, debug tooling.

### 7. Algorithms & Interactions
1. Drag Coalescing: On first MOVE_BLOCK dispatch, call `undo.begin('move-block')`; subsequent MOVE_BLOCK actions skip new undo entries; at drag end (pointer up), dispatch final MOVE_BLOCK (if changed) then `undo.commitIfChanged()`.
2. Arrange (Align/Distribute): Compute selection bounding box; for distribution, lock first & last block positions, compute uniform gap = (span - sumWidths)/(n-1); snap/clamp via reducer safety after dispatch (`MULTIDRAG_BLOCKS`).
3. Connection Routing:
	 - B√©zier: cubic; control points horizontally offset from source/target centers (simple heuristic: dx = |target.x - source.x|*0.4 + 40, with sign by direction).
	 - Orthogonal: polyline with horizontal then vertical (or vice versa) segments; simplified L-shape; arrow placed at end.
4. Minimap Rectangle: viewportRect.x = offset.x * (miniW / CANVAS_W); width = (clientWidth / scale) * (miniW / CANVAS_W); similar for Y.
5. Adaptive Grid: if `viewport.scale <= 0.55` add `grid-zoom-far`; minor gradients removed for clarity.
6. Save/Load Validation: Ensure maps are objects; each block id matches key; block has numeric position & size; each connection has id/source/target strings. Reject invalid with alert.
7. Undo Snapshot Equality: Skip creating a history entry if structural segments (blocks, connections, viewport, grid, connectionStyle) unchanged (deep compare serialized or iterative compare of keys & primitives).

### 8. Persistence Keys (Final Canonical Set)
```
fc-saved-charts      // Array<{ name:string; savedAt:string; state:AppState }>
fc-custom-themes     // Custom themes array
fc-theme-previews    // Theme preview cache
fc-theme             // Last selected theme name
fc-grid              // { enabled:boolean; size?:number; snap?:boolean }
fc-minimap-enabled   // '1' | '0'
```

### 9. Required DOM Structure (Runtime Generated)
```
div#app
	div.app-root
		(toolbar container injected early ‚Üí replaced by dynamic toolbar)
		div.fc-workspace-wrapper
			div.fc-canvas (absolute positioned logical canvas; id-less; width/height via CSS vars)
			svg.fc-svg-layer (connections)
			(optional minimap container appended to root outside workspace)
```
Block elements: `.fc-block` with inline styles `left/top/width/height`, child header, description, anchor.
Each `.fc-block` MUST contain exactly one child anchor element (class `.fc-block-anchor`) positioned (commonly on the right edge, vertically centered) serving as the interaction point for initiating a new connection draft (pointerdown + drag). Only this element starts connection creation; dragging elsewhere on the block body initiates a move.

### 10. Initialization Sequence
1. Construct `FlowchartApp(root)`.
2. Restore minimap & theme preferences (localStorage fetch inside constructor).
3. Build base layout (layout builder returns canvas element).
4. Instantiate managers (order matters: BlockManager, ConnectionManager, DraftController, ViewportController, ThemeManager, GridManager, FileIO, MinimapManager).
5. Enhance dispatch for undo + minimap updates.
6. Render initial empty state (`render()` calls managers to draw nothing but establish layers).
7. Attach toolbar with callbacks bound to undo operations.
8. After initial interactive creation, force undo baseline capture if supported.

### 11. Testing Strategy Outline
Replicate each item in Test Matrix with Vitest: mock DOM via jsdom; stub canvas context for minimap if needed; simulate dispatch for arrange, save/load, and grid toggle persistence.

### 12. Non-Goals Affirmation
Do not implement collaboration, server sync, advanced routing, heavy editor features, or external frameworks‚Äîkeeping bundle lightweight.

## Architecture

### Modular Design
- the main index.html should only reference the bundle script and the css and should have the main chart container.
- the chart should take the full screen
- All UI elements are dynamically created via their own specific component file.
- Use of a state manager with action/reducer pattern to hold the application state

## Implemented Features
### üîç System Overview Addendum
This specification is the single source of truth. Another engineer or LLM should be able to recreate the application (logic, UI, persistence, tests) solely from this file.

### üß¨ Core Data Schema
AppState shape (TypeScript-like):
```
interface AppState {
	blocks: { [id: string]: Block };
	connections: { [id: string]: Connection };
	selection: { blockId?: string; connectionId?: string };
	viewport: { scale:number; offset:{x:number;y:number}; bounds:{ minScale:number; maxScale:number } };
	connectionDraft?: { sourceBlock: string; currentPoint:{x:number;y:number} };
	connectionStyle: 'bezier'|'orthogonal';
	grid: { enabled:boolean; size:number; snap:boolean };
	historyVersion: number;
}
interface Block { id:string; kind:'start'|'process'|'decision'|'io'|'end'; position:{x:number;y:number}; size:{width:number;height:number}; title:string; descriptionHtml:string; properties:Record<string,any>; /* exactly one visual connection anchor rendered per block */ }
interface Connection { id:string; source:string; target:string; style:'bezier'|'orthogonal'; label?:string }
```

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Action Contract
ADD_BLOCK, UPDATE_BLOCK, MOVE_BLOCK, MULTIDRAG_BLOCKS, DELETE_BLOCK
ADD_CONNECTION, UPDATE_CONNECTION, DELETE_CONNECTION
SET_CONNECTION_STYLE
START_CONNECTION_DRAFT, UPDATE_CONNECTION_DRAFT, CANCEL_CONNECTION_DRAFT
SELECT_BLOCK, SELECT_CONNECTION, SET_MULTI_SELECT
SET_VIEWPORT, SET_GRID
INCREMENT_HISTORY (legacy incremental counter)
BULK_SET_STATE (partial replace/merge)

### ‚è™ Undo Operation Model
UndoManager uses begin/commitIfChanged/cancel. One undo step per logical operation (e.g., drag end). Operation labels: add-block, delete-block, move-block, set-conn-style, edit-block, toggle-grid, import-json, clear-all, reset-view, load-chart.

### üóÑ LocalStorage Keys
```
fc-saved-charts   // Array<SavedChartEntry>
fc-custom-themes  // Array<{ name:string; vars:Record<string,string> }>
fc-theme-previews // { [themeName]: { bg:string; accent:string } }
fc-grid-enabled   // '1' | '0' (optional)
```
SavedChartEntry: `{ name:string; savedAt:string; state:AppState }`.

### üíæ Save / Load Algorithms
Save: read list -> check name -> confirm overwrite -> replace/append -> persist -> timestamp ISO.
Load: list -> pick entry -> validate (maps, id consistency, required fields) -> BULK_SET_STATE -> renderAll -> applyViewport/grid -> undo baseline (load-chart).

### üìù WYSIWYG Editor
ContentEditable region for descriptionHtml. Toolbar commands (bold, italic, underline, link, image, media, save, cancel). Popups restore selection before insertion. Image/media -> full-width wrapper div. Paste heuristics: URL -> link; image URL/file -> image block; YouTube/video URL -> iframe/video block.

### üîê Validation
Load validation is lightweight (structural). Failing entries produce alert; data not mutated.

### üß™ Test Matrix (High-Level)
1 Add block each kind; undo baseline.
2 Drag coalescing single undo step.
3 Create/delete connection + undo/redo integrity.
4 Style toggle updates all connections.
5 JSON editor invalid -> error; valid -> commit & pretty-print.
6 WYSIWYG save vs cancel difference.
7 Image insertion full-width.
8 Media insertion YouTube -> iframe.
9 Selection preserved for link insertion.
10 Grid toggle persists.
11 Theme switch & custom theme registration persists preview.
12 Distinct undo steps for add/move/edit.
13 Save overwrite confirmation updates timestamp.
14 Tampered saved state rejected.
15 Delete saved chart updates storage.
16 Pagination with >24 entries.
17 Search filter narrows list.
18 Two-column layout when >12 wide screen.
19 Reset view restores default viewport.
20 Import JSON equality.

### üß© Theming Variables (Representative)
`--fc-bg, --fc-bg-alt, --fc-border, --fc-border-strong, --fc-text, --fc-accent, --fc-grid-minor, --fc-grid-major, --fc-dot, --fc-block-bg, --fc-block-header, --fc-toolbar-bg, --fc-toolbar-border, --fc-btn-bg, --fc-btn-hover, --fc-btn-active, --fc-popup-bg, --fc-danger, --fc-code-str, --fc-code-num, --fc-code-bool, --fc-code-null`.

### üîÑ Rendering Flow
Dispatch -> reducer -> enhanced dispatch side-effects -> managers render blocks & connections -> viewport + grid applied -> status updated.

### ü™ü Saved Charts UI Behavior
Recomputes list on dialog open; sort/search/pagination mutate derived subset; page reset on sort/filter; grid auto when >12 & width>900px.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
No grouping (beyond ad-hoc multi-select drag), server sync, or collaborative editing. execCommand reliance.

### üö´ Security
Assumes trusted local usage; production SHOULD sanitize descriptionHtml.

### ‚úÖ Block Management
- Add blocks of multiple kinds (start, process, decision, io, end)
- Drag & drop with rAF throttling and coalesced undo entries
	- Multi-select: Shift adds to selection; Ctrl/Cmd toggles membership; drag moves all selected blocks together while preserving relative offsets. MULTIDRAG_BLOCKS action dispatched with per-block target positions; single MOVE_BLOCK used when only one block involved. Plain (unmodified) click on any block while a multi-selection (>1 blocks) is active NO LONGER collapses the selection‚Äîthis preserves the multi-selection context. Only Shift (add) or Ctrl/Cmd (toggle) mutate the current multi-selection when more than one block is already selected.
	- Drag algorithm (single block): on pointerdown over block body record `startPointer` (screen coords) & `startPos` (block.position). On pointermove compute `dx,dy` in logical space using inverse viewport transform then target = `startPos + {dx,dy}`. Clamp target: `target.x = max(0, min(target.x, canvasWidth - block.width))`, similarly for y with canvasHeight and block.height. Dispatch MOVE_BLOCK only if target differs from current to avoid noise. On pointerup finalize; UndoManager commits one operation labeled `move-block`.
	- Drag algorithm (multi-block): record each block's `startPos`; compute shared delta from pointer movement; pre-clamp by forming group bounding box (minX,minY,maxX,maxY) then adjust delta so box stays within `[0,canvasWidth] x [0,canvasHeight]`. Apply delta to every selected block; dispatch MULTIDRAG_BLOCKS with full changes array. Reducer performs secondary per-block clamp (safety) to enforce `0 <= x <= canvasWidth - width` etc.
	- Group clamp: During multi-drag the combined bounding rectangle of all selected blocks is clamped to canvas bounds; delta adjusted so no block exits the canvas. Reducer applies a secondary group clamp for safety.
		- Selection marquee: Shift+drag on empty canvas draws a translucent rectangle selecting blocks fully enclosed; updates in real time; releases pointer to finalize multi-selection.
		- Multi-delete: Press Delete/Backspace with more than one block selected (and focus not in an editor) to remove all selected blocks in a single undo operation.
			- Select-all: Ctrl+A / Cmd+A (when focus not in editable field) selects every block and sets the first as primary.
- Single connection anchor per block for initiating connections
- Inline editable title (plain text) via double‚Äëclick
		- Rich HTML description editing via modular WYSIWYG editor (execCommand based) with save / cancel
			- Toolbar supports enhanced theming (gradient background, SVG icon buttons, accent save button) via CSS variables/classes
			- Modular popup for inserting/editing links (URL + text)
			- Pasting a URI auto-inserts as a link
			- Modular popups for inserting images & media (YouTube/video) with themed OK/Cancel buttons
			- Pasting image file or image URL auto-inserts as a full-width block (no adjacent content)
			- Pasting YouTube/video link auto-inserts as a full-width media block (iframe or video tag, no adjacent content)
- `properties` JSON object editable in dedicated JSON editor popup
- Automatic size observation (ResizeObserver) updates stored block size when content changes
- Drag clamping keeps blocks within canvas logical bounds

### ‚úÖ JSON Properties Editor
- Invoked from a block to edit its `properties` object as raw JSON.
- Backed by a `<textarea>` ensuring direct text editing (never hidden when editor visible).
- Live validation: parses on each input; shows status message ("Valid JSON" or detailed error) without committing invalid changes.
- Error feedback includes line, column, and absolute character position when available (e.g., `Error Ln 3, Col 15 (pos 57)`).
- Pretty-print (Format) button re-serializes valid JSON with 2-space indentation.
- Syntax highlighting layer (strings, numbers, booleans, null, punctuation) using lightweight regex tokenization.
- Highlight toggle (HL On/Off) allows user to disable coloring; auto-disabled for large payloads (>20k chars) to prevent performance issues.
- Status region color-coded (success / error) and announced via `aria-live="polite"` for accessibility.
- Esc key hint displayed (Esc to close popup) for consistent dismissal UX.
- Theming through CSS variables (e.g., `--fc-code-str`, `--fc-code-num`, etc.) so highlight colors adapt to current theme.
- Caret & selection remain usable with highlight enabled: textarea text becomes transparent while overlay shows tokens.

### ‚úÖ Undo / Redo System
- Central UndoManager maintains history of state snapshots.
- Baseline snapshot captured prior to first mutating action to enable full restoration.
- Action dispatch wrapper captures pre-action baseline for first change after load and handles coalescing logic.
- Coalesced MOVE_BLOCK actions: continuous drag movements during an active drag session collapse into a single history entry (reduces history noise and improves UX).
- Undo / Redo toolbar buttons plus keyboard shortcuts:
	- Ctrl+Z: Undo
	- Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z: Redo
- Internal flag (e.g., dragMoveActive) controls grouping scope for move operations.

### ‚úÖ Grid Overlay & Persistence
- Grid now enabled by default (`initialState.grid.enabled = true`)
- Toggle control in toolbar switches grid on/off and persists preference (localStorage)
- Dual-layer graph paper: minor (8px) + major (40px) lines theme-driven
- When disabled, a subtle sparse dotted pattern (customizable via CSS vars) provides visual texture

### ‚úÖ Toolbar & Hotkeys
- Central toolbar dynamically created at runtime.
- Provides at minimum: Undo, Redo, Grid Toggle, Connection Style switching (curved / orthogonal), and JSON properties editing trigger (contextual or via block UI).
- Data menu now includes enhanced local save/load:
	- Save chart with user-provided name (stored in localStorage with timestamp)
	- Overwrite protection: confirmation required if name already exists
	- Multiple named charts managed in a single `fc-saved-charts` array
	- Load dialog lists saved charts with human-readable timestamp
	- Sort toggle: by last saved date (desc, default) or by name (A‚ÜíZ)
	- Search filter (incremental, debounced) narrows chart list by name
	- Pagination (24 per page) with page indicators when filtered set exceeds page size
	- Two‚Äëcolumn adaptive grid when >12 entries and viewport width > 900px; otherwise single column
	- Responsive modal sizing (min 480px, up to 90vw capped at 780px; max-height 90vh) to minimize scrolling
	- Per‚Äëentry delete button (confirmation required) updates list live
	- Lightweight schema validation before load (verifies block & connection object maps: ids, kind, position/size integrity); invalid entries rejected with alert
	- Successful load refreshes rendered blocks & connections and records an undo baseline
- Hotkeys: Undo/Redo as above; Esc consistently cancels transient modes (e.g., connection drafting, properties popup) without applying unintended changes.

### ‚úÖ Connection System
- Visual connection creation via drag from a block anchor to target block
- SVG-based rendering (paths + arrowheads + delete affordance)
- Multiple styles: B√©zier (curved) & orthogonal; switchable live from toolbar
- Direction arrow markers & hover state styling
- Mid-connection trash icon for quick deletion
- Editable connection labels (default to connection id) rendered via `foreignObject` with inline editing & dynamic repositioning on block move
 - Directionality semantics: `source` (origin block) -> `target` (destination block). Arrowhead marker attached at path end closest to target block center. Path always begins at the source block's single anchor center point and terminates at a computed perimeter intersection point on the target block (simple heuristic: line from source anchor to target center then clamp to target bounding box edge). Marker orientation auto-derived from final segment direction (SVG marker `orient="auto"`).
 - During draft: provisional path updates with pointer; arrowhead only rendered after target block is confirmed (pointerup over valid block). Cancel via Esc removes draft without creating connection.

### ‚úÖ Navigation & Viewport
- Pan & zoom (wheel + touch pinch) with scale clamped to configured bounds
- Reset view button returns to default scale/offset
- Smooth pointer‚Äëbased panning and draft updating using shared screen‚Üílocal coordinate conversion

### ‚úÖ Interaction / Draft Cancellation
- Connection drafting (when user starts dragging from an anchor) can be canceled via Esc to avoid accidental connections.
- Consistent Esc behavior across editor contexts (drafts, property editor popup).

### ‚úÖ Performance Considerations
- Drag move coalescing reduces undo stack size and improves performance during block repositioning.
- requestAnimationFrame throttling ensures smooth block dragging without layout thrash.
- Syntax highlighting auto-disabled for large JSON payloads to prevent sluggish typing.

### ‚úÖ Accessibility
- JSON editor status (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`)
- Highlight overlay `aria-hidden="true"`
- Toolbar buttons semantic with titles / labels
- Connection labels & block titles editable via standard contentEditable / inputs for AT compatibility

### ‚úÖ Theming & Canvas
- Multi-theme support (default dark + light + high-contrast + blue + green + purple)
- Extensive CSS variable system (colors, grid lines, pattern dots, shadows)
- Canvas dimension variables: `--fc-canvas-width`, `--fc-canvas-height` (default 4000px each)
- Dotted background & graph paper colors theme-adjusted

### ‚úÖ Empty Initial Canvas
- Loads with no demo blocks for a clean workspace (user explicitly creates content)

### ‚úÖ Testing & Quality (Overview)
- Automated tests cover: undo/redo, grid toggle persistence, move coalescing, connection label editing + reposition, WYSIWYG editor, drag clamping
- JSON editor parsing deterministic with line/column error extraction

### ‚úÖ Modular Architecture (1.3 Refactor)
- `app.ts` responsibilities decomposed into focused modules:
	- `layout.ts` (DOM scaffold builder)
	- `GridManager.ts` (grid state persistence + application)
	- `ThemeManager.ts` (theme restore/persist)
	- `FileIO.ts` (export/import JSON state)
	- `HotkeysManager.ts` (keyboard shortcuts wiring)
	- Reducer extracted earlier into `reducer.ts` (already done pre‚Äë1.3) for clearer separation from type definitions.
- Promotes testability and future extension (e.g., additional managers) without inflating core app bootstrap file.

### ‚úÖ Reducer-Level Safety Clamp
### ‚úÖ Shared Configuration & DI (1.4)
### ‚úÖ Expanded Light Theme Set (1.5)
### ‚úÖ Theme Swatches & Custom Themes (1.6)
### üõ† Patch 1.6.1
- Swatch preview generation now derives real CSS variable values per theme via `ThemeManager.ensurePreviewForBuiltin` instead of heuristic guesses (which rendered blank/white squares in some cases).
- Toolbar theme menu updated to consult centralized preview cache for consistency and persistence.

- Theme menu now displays visual swatches (background + accent) for quick scanning.
- Added modal (replacing prompt) for injecting custom theme JSON mapping of CSS variables (only `--fc-` prefixed keys applied).
- Custom themes persisted in `localStorage` (`fc-custom-themes`) and restored on load; previews cached (`fc-theme-previews`).
- Dynamic registration generates a `<style>` block with `:root[data-theme="<name>"] { ... }` scoping.
- Users can immediately switch to the newly created theme; status bar reflects custom theme activation.

- Added multiple light‚Äëoriented themes to improve accessibility and user preference coverage: `light-blue`, `light-green`, `light-orange`, `light-gray`, `light-contrast`.
- Theme selector updated to expose new variants; all inherit semantic token model ensuring consistent component styling.
- Each light theme tunes grid contrast, connection colors, and JSON token palette for adequate readability on bright backgrounds.

- Central `config.ts` exports `DEFAULT_CANVAS_WIDTH` / `DEFAULT_CANVAS_HEIGHT` used by reducer and CSS variables (eliminates magic numbers in logic).
- Manager interfaces (`interfaces.ts`): `IGridManager`, `IThemeManager`, `IFileIO`, `IHotkeysManager` plus `AppDependencies` for dependency injection.
- `FlowchartApp` constructor accepts optional partial `AppDependencies` enabling headless/unit tests to supply mocks (e.g., stubbed grid or theme managers) without touching DOM or localStorage.
- Managers updated to `implements` their interfaces ensuring swappability and compile-time contract checking.

- MOVE_BLOCK action now clamps positions within fixed canvas bounds (4000x4000) in addition to UI-level clamp, ensuring programmatic moves cannot escape.

## Deferred / Potential Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)
	- Modular popup for image/media block insertion (full-width enforced)
	- Paste handler for images/media (auto block insertion)
- Full project persistence (save/load flow definitions) beyond manual JSON export
- Search / filter blocks & properties
- Schema-aware validation / JSON folding
- Additional keyboard shortcuts (format JSON, toggle highlight, focus search)
- Connection label collision avoidance / smart reposition
- Connection routing improvements (obstacle avoidance)
- Snap-to-major-grid (currently basic snap by grid.size when enabled)
- Snap-to-major-grid (currently basic snap by grid.size when enabled)

## Architectural Notes (Addendum)
- Dynamic UI generation keeps `index.html` minimal (script + stylesheet + container only).
- State manager with action/reducer pattern underpins deterministic updates suitable for undo snapshots.
- Undo integration wraps dispatch to ensure snapshots occur exactly once per logical user action or coalesced action group.
- JSON editor kept dependency-free (no external libraries) to minimize bundle size and complexity.

## Non-Goals (Current Scope)
- Real-time multi-user collaboration.
- Server-side persistence or cloud sync.
- Rich code editor features (folding, multi-cursor) beyond lightweight highlighting.

## Summary
Version 1.3 delivers a structural modular refactor (manager pattern) and introduces reducer-level movement clamping, while retaining all 1.2 feature gains (grid, labels, WYSIWYG, dotted background, theming). The codebase is now cleaner for ongoing feature growth (persistence, routing intelligence, advanced editing ergonomics).

## Patch 1.7.14 (Multi-Select Plain Click Guard)
- Added guard preventing accidental collapse of an active multi-selection when performing a plain click on a selected block (or another block) while more than one block is selected. This ensures users can interact (e.g., begin a drag) without losing their multi-selection unless they explicitly modify it with Shift (add) or Ctrl/Cmd (toggle).
- Updated specs to reflect clarified multi-select interaction model.

## Patch 1.6.2 (Undo/Redo Stabilization)
- ## Patch 1.6.3 (Undo Noise Reduction)
- ## Patch 1.6.4 (Undo Debug Panel & Test Alignment)
- Reintroduced historyVersion increment on MOVE_BLOCK to maintain compatibility with existing unit tests expecting version changes per move.
- Added optional runtime debug panel (enable via `?undoDebug=1` in URL) displaying undo/redo stack depths and top history versions.
- Panel offers actions: Dump (console snapshot), ForceCap (manual snapshot), Clear (development-only stack reset).
- UndoManager now dispatches `fc:undo:debug` CustomEvents after every snapshot or traversal, enabling external instrumentation.
- Drag moves now create exactly one undo entry per completed drag (baseline at pointer down, final snapshot at drag end). Intermediate MOVE_BLOCK actions are not recorded.
- Block creation coalesced into a single undo step (ADD_BLOCK plus initial size observation updates no longer require multiple undo presses).
- Removed historyVersion increments on each MOVE_BLOCK to prevent artificial version churn; final drag-end capture handles version boundary.
- Simplified dispatch wrapper: discrete mutations capture only post-change state; baseline snapshots removed except for drag start.
- Further snapshot deduplication leverages existing structural equality checks in UndoManager.
- Eliminated no-op history entries: `UndoManager` now ignores snapshots identical in core structure (blocks, connections, viewport, grid, connection style).
- `MOVE_BLOCK` reducer increments `historyVersion` only when position actually changes; early return for zero-delta moves prevents noisy history growth during micro drags or redundant dispatches.
- Drag sequencing: baseline snapshot captured at drag start; incremental move actions update state & historyVersion; final state capture occurs without duplicating unchanged snapshots.
- Discrete (non-move) mutations now capture pre-action baseline and post-action result ensuring a clear before/after pair while deduplicating if reducer didn't effect a change.
- Added guarded post-mutation history bump when reducer did not advance `historyVersion` (e.g., viewport tweaks) to keep undo semantics consistent.
- Prevented add-block popup appearing during undo/redo by canceling any active connection draft prior to history traversal (ensures stray draft completion logic cannot fire after state rewind).

## Version 1.7.0 (Operation-Based Undo/Redo Rewrite)
- Replaced version-based snapshot capturing with explicit operation lifecycle (begin/commit/cancel).
- Each logical user action produces at most one undo step: add/delete/move (on drop)/edit (title, description, properties)/style change/grid toggle/viewport reset/import/clear-all.
- Dragging a block only records on drop; intermediate MOVE_BLOCK dispatches are ignored for history purposes.
- Block creation and initial size adjustments (ResizeObserver) coalesced via microtask commit.
- New `UndoManager` API: `begin(label)`, `commitIfChanged()`, `cancel()`, `run(label, fn)`; legacy methods retained as harmless shims.
- Undo stack stores pre-change snapshots with labels; redo restores forward states operation-by-operation.
- Debug panel updated to surface operation labels and active operation state.

## Patch 1.7.1 (Local Save Management Enhancements)
- Added overwrite confirmation to Save Chart dialog to prevent accidental replacement of existing named charts.
- Load dialog revamped with per‚Äëentry Load / Delete controls and scrollable list.
- Added sort toggle (Date desc default / Name asc) for saved charts.
- Implemented lightweight schema validation (blocks + connections basic shape) prior to applying a loaded state; invalid data rejected with user feedback.
- Added per‚Äëentry delete with confirmation; changes persist immediately to `localStorage`.
- Updated specs to reflect new persistence behaviors (overwrite protection, sorting, deletion, validation).

## Patch 1.7.2 (Saved Charts UX Improvements)
- Responsive Load Chart modal (auto width ‚â§90vw capped at 780px; max-height 90vh).
- Added search filter (debounced) for saved chart names.
- Added pagination (24 items per page) with page controls and total count display.
- Automatic two-column grid layout when large result sets (>12 entries) and sufficient screen width.
- Increased spacing and adaptive layout; scrollbar rarely needed unless extreme counts.

## Patch 1.7.3 (Specification Consolidation)
- Elevated specification to authoritative source including: full AppState schema, action contract, undo operation catalog, theming variable set, save/load algorithms, WYSIWYG behavior, test matrix, and localStorage key registry.
- Added explicit rendering flow documentation and security/limitation notes.
- Clarified saved chart validation and UI interaction rules (sort, search, pagination, grid switch).

## Patch 1.7.4 (Selection Count Status)
- Status bar now always appends current selection count when at least one block is selected.
- Multi-select and single selection both reported as: `... Zoom: 100% Selected: N`.
- Zero selection omits the suffix for brevity.

## Patch 1.7.5 (Arrange: Align & Distribute)
- Added toolbar Arrange (üìê) menu exposing alignment and distribution operations for multi-selected blocks.
- Alignment commands: Align Left / Center / Right (horizontal), Align Top / Middle / Bottom (vertical).
- Distribution commands: Distribute Horizontal / Distribute Vertical (even spacing of gaps between block edges, preserving first & last positions).
- Implementation details:
	- `runArrange(kind)` gathers current multi-selection (requires ‚â•2 blocks) and computes target positions.
	- For align operations, only the relevant axis is modified (e.g., align-left sets all left x to group minimum; align-middle centers each block vertically relative to group bounding box).
	- For distribution, interior blocks are repositioned so gaps between adjacent block edges are equal. First and last blocks remain fixed to preserve outer bounds.
	- Reducer safety clamp still applies via `MULTIDRAG_BLOCKS` to keep the entire adjusted group inside canvas bounds.
	- All selected blocks (changed and unchanged) are included in the dispatched `MULTIDRAG_BLOCKS` changes array to ensure accurate group clamp calculations; unchanged blocks retain their coordinates.
	- DOM synchronization: enhanced dispatch now updates `.style.left/.top` for every moved (or potentially clamped) block after `MOVE_BLOCK` and `MULTIDRAG_BLOCKS` actions‚Äîcovers programmatic arrange operations (previously only drag path updated DOM immediately).
	- Undo integration: each arrange action captured as a single operation labeled `arrange-blocks` (one undo step). Redo restores pre‚Äëarranged layout.
- Tests added:
	- Horizontal distribution correctness (equalized gaps) with grid disabled for deterministic values.
	- Align-right correctness (right edges equal) including unchanged block participation.
- Edge cases / safeguards:
	- If selection <2 blocks, operation aborts with status message (no-op).
	- Zero effective position delta (already aligned) reports `Arrange: no changes` (no undo entry created).
	- Grid snapping applies post-calculation through reducer when enabled, potentially quantizing arranged positions.
- Future considerations (not implemented yet): disable menu entries when insufficient selection; visual flash or guideline overlays; distribution preview before commit.

## Patch 1.7.6 (Minimap Navigation)
- Added fixed-position minimap (default 200x200px) bottom-right overlay showing block positions and current viewport.
- Renders lightweight rectangles for each block scaled against logical canvas size (4000x4000).
- Viewport outline (yellow) reflects visible region derived from viewport offset & scale and current canvas client dimensions.
- Interactions:
	- Click on minimap recenters main viewport at clicked logical point.
	- Drag the viewport rectangle to pan main canvas continuously.
- Implementation: `MinimapManager` listens to store updates (blocks, viewport, selection) via dispatch hook and re-renders with rAF throttling.
- Scaling: `miniX = block.position.x * (miniW / CANVAS_W)`, likewise for Y/width/height.
- Selected block highlighted with accent color rectangle (distinct fill).
- Undo unaffected (pure navigation adjustments dispatch viewport changes outside undo stack semantics).
- Future enhancements (not implemented): connection previews, zoom slider, minimap toggle visibility, dynamic sizing based on content extents.

## Patch 1.7.7 (Minimap Reposition & Toggle)
- Minimap moved from bottom-right to bottom-left to comply with updated layout requirements (avoids overlap with existing status elements on some viewports).
- Added toolbar Minimap (üó∫) button to toggle visibility. Button reflects active state (CSS `active` class) based on current minimap visibility.
- `FlowchartApp` maintains `minimapEnabled` boolean flag; `toggleMinimap()` updates flag, calls `MinimapManager.setVisible()`, and posts status message (`Minimap on/off`).
- `MinimapManager` now exposes `setVisible(on:boolean)`, `isVisible()`, and `getElement()` helpers for future feature extensions (e.g., persistence, animations).
- Display toggle does not affect undo history (pure UI visibility). Viewport navigation remains functional when re-enabled (state changes always dispatched even when hidden).
- Specification updated to reflect new control; previous future enhancement note about minimap toggle visibility now realized.
- Persistence: minimap visibility stored in `localStorage` key `fc-minimap-enabled` (`'1'` or `'0'`) and restored on load before instantiating manager so initial state matches prior session.

## Patch 1.7.8 (Graph Paper Grid Refinement)
- Adjusted grid to resemble traditional engineering graph paper at 100% zoom.
- Introduced CSS variables `--fc-grid-minor-size` (default 20px) and `--fc-grid-major-size` (default 100px) in theme root for consistent scaling and easy theme overrides.
- Updated `.fc-canvas.with-grid` to use these variables instead of hard-coded 8px / 40px values; major lines remain darker (`--fc-grid-major`) while minor lines use `--fc-grid-minor` for subtle contrast.
- Layout now produces evenly spaced minor intersections (every 20 logical pixels) with strong major lines every 5 minors.
- Future option: dynamic scaling of grid size when zooming far out/in (not implemented yet).

## Patch 1.7.9 (Grid Contrast Enhancement)
- Introduced dedicated variables `--fc-grid-minor-line` and `--fc-grid-major-line` decoupling color choice from size logic for clarity and theme flexibility.
- Increased major line stroke thickness to 2px while retaining 1px minor lines, improving legibility at 100% zoom on high‚ÄëDPI displays.
- Dark theme: intensified major line (`--fc-grid-major` darkened to `#42474d`) while keeping minor lines subtle for authentic graph paper layering.
- Light theme: major line darkened relative to minor (`#b9c1ca` vs `#e4e8ee`) and line vars exposed explicitly for downstream light variants.
- `.fc-canvas.with-grid` now references line variables instead of structural color tokens, enabling potential future adaptive contrast adjustments.
- No functional logic changes; purely visual refinement. Undo / state management unaffected.

## Patch 1.7.10 (Grid Density & Major Line Softening)
- Reduced minor grid size from 20px to 16px and major grid interval from 100px to 80px (still 5√ó minor). This increases perceived graph paper density at default (100%) zoom, making block alignment landmarks feel closer and more natural for typical flow sizes.
- Lightened major line color in both dark and light default themes to soften contrast introduced in 1.7.9 while preserving structural hierarchy via thickness (2px) + subtle tonal shift instead of heavy darkness.
	- Dark theme major line: `#42474d` ‚Üí `#3a4046`.
	- Light theme major line: `#b9c1ca` ‚Üí `#c1c8d0`.
- Rationale: High-contrast thick major lines at previous spacing (20/100) visually dominated sparse diagrams; tighter spacing plus gentler chroma produces an authentic engineering pad aesthetic without distraction.
- Implementation: Variable adjustments only (`--fc-grid-minor-size`, `--fc-grid-major-size`, and updated `--fc-grid-major` values); no layout or JS changes. Existing gradient layering & line variable indirection remain unchanged.
- Risk assessment: Low. Tests unaffected (no assertions on specific pixel values of CSS variables). Undo / rendering logic untouched.
- Future consideration: adaptive grid stepping (e.g., hide minor lines beyond certain zoom thresholds) could further enhance clarity when zoomed far out; deferred.

## Patch 1.7.11 (Adaptive Grid & Theme Alignment)
- Applied softened major grid color adjustments to all built-in themes (blue, green, purple, light-blue, light-green, light-orange, light-gray, light-contrast) to maintain consistent hierarchy after core dark/light tweak in 1.7.10.
- Introduced adaptive grid behavior: when viewport scale drops below 0.55, minor grid lines are hidden (class `grid-zoom-far`) leaving only major lines (2px) for reduced visual noise during high-level navigation.
- Implementation details:
	- `ViewportController` already emits `viewport:change`; `GridManager` now subscribes (via injected EventBus) and toggles `grid-zoom-far` class based on threshold.
	- CSS adds `.fc-canvas.with-grid.grid-zoom-far` variant with only major line gradients (minor layers removed) for performance and clarity.
	- Threshold stored in `GridManager.farThreshold` (0.55) for easy future tuning or potential theming.
- Fallback safety: adaptive class removed whenever grid disabled to avoid stale styling when re-enabled at different zoom levels.
- No state schema changes; feature purely stylistic/reactive. Test coverage unchanged (no tests asserted pixel-level grid visuals). Low regression risk.
- Future options: multi-tier adaptation (e.g., second threshold to reduce major thickness) and smooth transition via opacity instead of immediate layer removal.

## Patch 1.7.12 (Comprehensive Reconstruction Spec)
- Updated specification version to 1.7.12 and appended an extensive "Rebuild Guide" detailing module responsibilities, data contracts, algorithms, persistence keys, DOM expectations, and initialization order.
- Clarified adaptive grid threshold (0.55) and ensured explicit listing of all active localStorage keys (added `fc-theme`, `fc-grid`, `fc-minimap-enabled`).
- Added reconstruction checklist enabling deterministic recreation by another engineer or LLM without the original codebase.
- No runtime behavioral changes‚Äîdocumentation only. Serves as consolidation milestone preparing for potential external publication / open-source release.

## Patch 1.7.13 (Drag, Anchor & Direction Clarifications)
- Clarified explicit drag algorithms for single and multi-block movement including logical delta computation and boundary clamping (0..canvasWidth - width / 0..canvasHeight - height) with group clamp pre-adjustment plus reducer safety clamp.
- Documented mandatory single connection anchor per block (`.fc-block-anchor`) and its role as the sole initiation point for connection drafting; dragging elsewhere performs block move.
- Expanded Connection System section with detailed directionality semantics (source -> target), arrowhead marker placement/orientation, draft behavior (provisional path, arrowhead only after confirmation), and perimeter intersection heuristic for target endpoint.
- Added DOM structure requirement paragraph specifying presence and typical positioning of `.fc-block-anchor` inside each block element.
- Updated Block interface comment noting exactly one visual anchor per block.
- Documentation-only patch; no code changes implied.
